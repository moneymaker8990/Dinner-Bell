# Product positioning and gaps (Section 4 summary)

## Summary

| Dimension | Dinner Bell today | Partiful (reference) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Niche | Dinner hosting (menu, bring list, bell) | General party invites |
| Bell moment | Core: push + in-app sound/haptics | None |
| Bring list | Realtime claiming, mark provided | Not central |
| Invite design | Functional (link, email, SMS) | Highly customizable |
| Payments | None | Venmo/Cash App/PayPal |
| Discovery | Discover tab ships; copy aligned with “List in Discover” | Guest discovery, mutuals |
| Photos on event | DB only, no UI | Yes |
| Drafts | Single draft restore, no list | Supported |
| Account (email/password) | Change email + password supported | Full account management |

## Remaining holes to fix for credibility

- Drafts are currently single-draft restore only; either keep copy as "Resume draft" or add a full Drafts list.
- Premium messaging should stay hidden or clearly marked "Coming soon" until entitlements are implemented.
- Photos-on-event UI is still missing (DB supports it but no user-facing flow).

## What makes Dinner Bell special

- Dinner-first product
- The bell moment
- Realtime bring list + menu + recap

## Strategic direction

Leaning into "the app for dinner" and the bell, while closing the most visible gaps, is the strongest path to standing out.
